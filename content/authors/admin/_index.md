My research goal is to make AI systems to be trustworthy, robust, align with human values, and perform well in real-world applications (e.g., social goods, self-driving, healthcare, human-AI interaction, etc.). My research experience focuses on analyzing the decision rules (understanding ability) of models in legal judgment prediction (LJP) and relation extraction (RE) and improving their performance, robustness, and generalization ability in text generation, time series, LJP, and RE.
